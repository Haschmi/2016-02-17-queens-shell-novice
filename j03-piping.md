Now that we know most of the basic UNIX commands, we are going to explore some more advanced features. The first of these features is the wildcard `*`. In our examples before, we've done things to files one at a time and otherwise had to specify things explicitly.

Each of the commands we've used so far does only a very small amount of stuff. However, it's extremely easy to chain UNIX commands together in new and awesome ways.
