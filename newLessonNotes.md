# new lesson plan notes

##00-intro

+ whoami  
+ pwd  
+ file system overview
+ ls (-l, -a, arguments)

##02-file handling

reorganize these
+ mkdir
+ nano text editor (vi instead?)
+ cat
+ less/more
+ rm (doesn't work on directories, files gone forever)
+ rmdir
+ rm -r
+ mv for renaming, moving

get rid of challenge problems at end and replace with something more relevant

##03-pipefilter

+ wildcards
+ wc (-w, -l, -c)
+ ">"
+ sort (-n, add uniq?)
+ head, tail
+ "|"

skim down examples, some are good

##04-scripts

+ comments
+ they are running scripts with "bash" first
+ #! in scripts
+ permissions/chmod/sudo
+ introduce shell variables first with echo
+ shell script arguments - $@ - all arguments
+ basic for loops

+ concatenation with shell variables, {} for grouping
+ use quotes to make things robust vs. spaces

script reading comprehension examples are great
